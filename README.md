# Terminal Message
Send messages through iMessage via the command line. My scripts have been combined with CamHenlin/imessageclient, go check out his project here: https://github.com/CamHenlin/imessageclient

## Example command
```
node get-conversation.js
```

## Notes
* Ensure that accessibility settings are allowed for Terminal or iTerm2
* Hit the letter `q` when nothing is selected to close the window
  * After sending a message, hit `tab` and `q` to close the window

## To Do
* Integrate a receive message feature in the command line
* Integrate group chats or multiple contacts
* Clear written text after sending in the blessed interface
* Add functionality so the conversations column is up to date with most recent texts
* Stop messages application from popping up when sending a message
* Get contact names and proper group chat names in the conversations column
* Add contact names to messages
